# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

This is a console-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built in **C language** where a human player competes against an unbeatable **AI opponent** powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Fully playable 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.
- 🤖 Smart computer moves using **Minimax Algorithm**.
- 👤 Human vs AI gameplay with turn-based interaction.
- 🧩 Move validation and winner/draw checking.
- 🖥️ Simple and clean text-based UI.

---

## 📌 Gameplay Snapshot

The board uses the following cell mapping for input:

```

## 1 | 2 | 3

## 4 | 5 | 6

7 | 8 | 9

```

- **Player** uses `X`
- **Computer** uses `O`
- The computer always makes the **first move**

🎯 **Goal:** Align three of your symbols (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) before your opponent does.

---

## 🧠 Minimax Algorithm

The **Minimax algorithm** is used to evaluate all possible future states of the game and select the **optimal move** for the computer, ensuring the best chance of winning or at least drawing.

- AI always plays optimally.
- Human players need to block and plan ahead to avoid losing.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- GCC or any C compiler
- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `stdbool.h`, `time.h`)

### 🧪 To Compile
```bash
gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tictactoe
````

### ▶️ To Run

```bash
./tictactoe
```

## ✨ Highlights

* Modular code structure with functions like:

  * `showInstructions()`, `initialise()`, `gameOver()`
  * `findBestMove()` using Minimax
  * `evaluate()` for board scoring
* Handles invalid user input gracefully
* Clean output formatting for game board and results
